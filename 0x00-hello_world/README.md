#0x00. C - Hello, World
~~~~
"C - Hello, World" is a simple introductory programming project that involves writing a program in the C programming language that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. The project is designed to be a first step for beginner programmers to learn the basic syntax and structure of C programming.

The project typically involves creating a new C file in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE), and then writing the code to print the "Hello, World!" text to the screen using the printf() function. The code is then compiled and executed using a C compiler.

The project is named after the traditional first program that many programmers write when learning a new language, which is to output the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. The project is often used as a starting point for learning more advanced C programming concepts and techniques.
